# Usage

Use this widget as a means of navigating between steps in a process (e.g. submission, account creation, app tutorial/walk-through etc...). 
A tab bar is created by using a `ProgressTabBar` and filling it with multiple `ProcessTab`. The tab bar allows for styling 
of color, text, outline and dimensions of the tab.
